# UpgradePlus
UpgradePlus is an upgrade mod inspired by [Oempa's Equipment Upgrader mod](https://github.com/Levi2229/UpgradeEquipment)  

The Blacksmith is a TownNPC available after beating Eoc, EoW, or BoC. Fight bosses and strong mobs for tokens you can trade to upgrade your gear, take your favorite weapons deeper into the game or grind past difficult bosses.

## Features
* Directly Upgrade Weapons, Wings, Armor & Accessories through instanced GlobalItems
* Configs: Crit Rollover, 4 stat balance presets, configurable weapon autofire, stat bonus tuning, and slightly more!
* New Stats: Bonus Crit Damage & Wing Speed upgrades
* QoL: Right click to max & token sleeves automatically convert to tokens during purchases

## Known Bugs & Issues
* Mana cost isn't updated in item descriptions (tML bug)
* Speed upgrades don't effect mining speeds (tML bug)
* The upgrade slot shows a ¹ in the corner because it's an inventory slot internally
