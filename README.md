# UpgradePlus
UpgradePlus is an upgrade mod based on [Oempa's Equipment Upgrader mod](https://github.com/Levi2229/UpgradeEquipment)  

The Blacksmith is a TownNPC available after beating Eoc, EoW, or BoC. Trade in tokens for Weapon, Armor, Accessory, or Wing upgrades. Beat bosses or strong mobs to get tokens, higher boss hp = more tokens.

## New Features
* Upgrade your armor, wings, and accessories
* Mana reduction added to mage weapons
* (Config) Autofire if your weapon is at or past level 40


## Improvements
* Items remember favorites  
Itemslot.Context swapped from `BankItem` to `InventoryItem`
* Right click the reforge button to buy max upgrades
* Preview the cost to reach cap

## Planned
* Better Blacksmith sprite

## Known Bugs
* Calamity wipes the levels from gear when reforging from the goblin tinkerer  
Goblin tinkerer will refund items at standard rates when calamity is enabled to compensate
* Pojectiles don't crit more from the crit chance given by upgrading, crit rollover still works as intended 
* The upgrade slot shows a ¹ in the corner because it's an inventory slot internally
