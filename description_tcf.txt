The Blacksmith NPC can arrive after Eye of Cthulhu, Skeletron, or a world-evil boss is defeated. Talk to him to trade tokens and token sleeves from your inventory to upgrade gear. Tokens drop from any NPC with more than 1k hp or any boss, they drop in a range based on [ISPOILER]enemy HP+Atk+Def, doubling in [/ISPOILER][ISPOILER]hardmode and again in post ML for 4x base token drops.[/ISPOILER]
