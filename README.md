The Blacksmith is a TownNPC available after beating Eater of Worlds, Eye of Cthulhu, or Brain of Cthulhu, trade in tokens for Weapon, Armor, Accessory, or Wing upgrades. Beat bosses or strong mobs to get tokens, higher boss hp = more tokens.

## New Features
* Upgrade your armor, wings, and accessories
* Mana reduction added to mage weapons
* (Config) Autofire if your weapon is at or past level 40


## Improvements

Itemslot.Context swapped from `BankItem` to `InventoryItem`

## Known Bugs
* Calamity wipes the levels from gear when reforging from the goblin tinkerer  
Goblin tinkerer will refund items at standard rates when calamity is enabled to compensate
* A Weapon's upgraded crit chance isn't applied to their projectiles, but *is* factored into crit rollover
